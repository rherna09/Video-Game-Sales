# Video-Game-Sales ##project was an intro to data science project in which a fictitious start up video game company is doing market research to determine what markets to focus on and what video game genre's will generate optimal sales opportunities.  The project was done on R.  Some of the code has depricated but the code is still provided despite the issues.  There is a report that is also attached and the report captures the visualizations and tables that the code generated.  The report answers questions that will benefit the fictitious company.  This was my first data science project and the code is provided for references purposes.##
