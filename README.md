# Video-Game-Sales project was an intro to data science project in which a fictitious start up video game company is doing market research to determine 
# what markets to focus on and what video game genre's will generate the most sales in the markets.  The project was done on R studio.  Some of the code
# has depricated but the code is still provided despite the issues.  There is a report that is also attached and the report captures the visualizations and tables
# that the code generated.  The report answers questions that will benefit the fictitious company.  This was the first data science project and the code is provided
# for references purposes.
